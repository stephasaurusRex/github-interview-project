Cards
===

Some dummy elements to demo the project structure.

You can display your cards in a list with this component.

```js
import CardList from "components/CardList";

const MyList = () =>
  <CardList>
    <CardList.Card title="hello world">card 1</CardList.Card>
    <CardList.Card title="hello world">card 2</CardList.Card>
    <CardList.Card title="hello world">card 3</CardList.Card>
  </CardList>
```
